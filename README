This is a consumer (Relying party) implementation of OpenId 2.0, written in go.

I am rewriting this library, the previous version was incomplete and unsafe.

For this reason, I decided to completely remove the old version.
Check previous revisions in git history if you are looking for something
that sort of works, yet *unsafe*.

Here is another open-id consumer library in go:
